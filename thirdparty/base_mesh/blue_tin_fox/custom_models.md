# Custom Character Models

The main reason why we are releasing these models open source is so people can make their own models or customize the existing models.

Making a new model should be fairly simple.

## What you don't need:

- You don't even need a rigged skeleton. (It will work without - of course you can't pose it)
- You don't need a standard skeleton. (You can pose any bones. So you could have a rigged dog.)
- You don't need blend shapes / morph targets.
- You can have any blend shapes you want (It will load them in dynamically)

## What you need:

- A model with a mesh
- A single material with a single texture

## Some custom examples:

- A character downloaded off the internet with no rig and you don't need to pose it
- A dog - Who's a good boy?

- A snake
- A monster
- A person with very specific morph targets
- A very specific model with lots of detail
- A model based on one of these models you slightly edited
