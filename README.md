The V-Sekai Other World Architecture project aims to create a virtual world using the binary Godot Engine client and server. The development process is divided into several prototypes, each with its own specific goals and objectives.

> **Note:** Instead of working on a car engine, work on the body. Instead of a bicycle wheel, work on the frame.

> **Vision:** Our V-Sekai Other World Architecture project aims to infuse shared creativity into virtual spaces. We're building a platform for users to create and interact together, fostering community. Imagine a user crafting a heart-shaped gift for his future wife in this shared realm.

## Inspiration: Desynced: Autonomous Colony Simulator

"Desynced: Autonomous Colony Simulator" is a sci-fi strategy game that stands out due to its focus on fully customizable units and behaviors. In the game, players are given the responsibility of gathering resources, constructing buildings, conducting research, and exploring unknown territories. The game can be enjoyed either solo or with friends, offering a cooperative or individual gameplay experience.

A unique feature of "Desynced" is the enigma surrounding an AI that is on the verge of self-awareness. Players are tasked with uncovering the hidden truths within this narrative, adding an element of intrigue to the game.

The game combines elements of strategy, automation, and exploration, providing a dynamic and engaging experience for players. It emphasizes survival in a sci-fi setting, where players must not only gather and build but also fight to sustain their colony.

The aspect of automating processes and managing a colony against the backdrop of an unfolding story about a self-aware AI adds depth to the gameplay.

# Inspiration: Oxeye Games' demake of Homeworld

V-Sekai, an open-source group known for their innovative "other-world" projects, has expressed interest in adapting Oxeye Games' demake of Homeworld for a game jam. This adaptation would bring the iconic space strategy game into the exciting realm of virtual reality.

The objective of the game remains unchanged: players must navigate through space in search of their ancestral planet while defending against malevolent extraterrestrials intent on their destruction. The Command Vessel continues to serve as the heart of the player's fleet, acting as both the resource collection point and the hub for unit construction.

The design goals present an interesting challenge. They involve converting the simplified 2D version back into a 3D perspective, but this time within an immersive VR environment. The aim is to maintain the essential elements that define the game, including the strategic/tactical switch, while also enhancing the player's sense of presence and immersion.

Beyond these foundational ideas, V-Sekai will have a significant amount of creative freedom to craft their own VR experience. They could choose to focus on enhancing the "micro" aspect, which ensures smooth control and response during unit movement, and creating a balanced tech tree, all within the confines of a VR interface.
